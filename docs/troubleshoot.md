# Troubleshooting Guide

## {octicon}`bug;0.85em` Quick guide to troubelshooting

If your run fails or behaves unexpectedly, follow these steps in order. This helps you identify the root cause and collect the information needed to fix the problem or report it clearly.

1. Run the command again and capture the full Snakemake output.

2. Open the job-specific log file in the results directory and the `.snakemake --use-conda/log` directory.

3. Confirm the input paths, sample list, and configuration values in `config.yml` or the command line.

4. Reproduce the error using a dry run or smaller command when possible.

5. Search the repository documentation and GitHub issues for similar failures.

## {octicon}`book;0.85em` Log files

- Shell output printed by Snakemake on the terminal.
- `logs/` inside your output directory: module-specific stdout/stderr logs.
- `.snakemake/log/`: Snakemake rule execution logs and metadata.
- `.vomix/log/<timestamp>/config.json`: run metadata for the current analysis.

If you are using a cluster executor, scheduler logs may also be available from your cluster system (`qstat`, `squeue`, `qacct`, or the equivalent command).

## {octicon}`question;0.85em` FAQ & Common Issues

:::{dropdown} Conda / environment creation fails
:open: false

- Ensure you activated the correct environment: `conda activate vomix`.
- If Snakemake cannot create environments, verify that `conda`, `mamba`, or your container engine is installed and available.
- For Apptainer mode, use `snakemake --sdm apptainer --use-conda` and verify your Apptainer/Singularity setup.

:::{dropdown} CreateCondaEnvironmentException: Conda version too old
:open: false

This is a known behavior in Snakemake 8+. To ensure strict reproducibility and security regarding package isolation, modern versions of Snakemake require a relatively up-to-date Conda framework (version 24.7.1 or later). Because your system is running an older conda version (4.10.3), Snakemake refuses to spin up the rule-specific environments. This requirement persists across newer v8+ releases, so updating Snakemake alone will not bypass this check—you need to provide a newer Conda executable.

Here are the best ways to fix it depending on how much control you have over your environment:

- Method 1: The "Hacker's Quick Fix" (No Admin/Global Updates Needed). If you are on a shared cluster or do not want to modify your base environment, install a newer version of conda directly inside your active Snakemake environment. Activate the environment where Snakemake is installed and run:

```bash
conda install conda>=24.7.1
```

Because Snakemake relies on Python's environment paths, it will intercept the updated internal conda package instead of reaching out to your old system-wide version.

- Method 2: The Canonical Way (Update your global/base Conda). If you own the system or are using an isolated local install (like Miniconda or Miniforge), updating your base package manager is the cleanest route. From your base environment, run:

```bash
conda update -n base -c defaults conda
```

If you are using Miniforge/Mambaforge, swap `-c defaults` with `-c conda-forge`.

- Method 3: Bypassing the check (The "I'm in a hurry" option). If you are completely blocked from updating software and you know your old conda works fine, you can bypass the version check entirely by manually commenting out the restriction in Snakemake's source code. Find your active Snakemake source files:

```bash
cd $(python -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages()[0])")/snakemake/deployment
```

Open `conda.py` with a text editor and remove or comment out the block raising `CreateCondaEnvironmentException` in the `_check_version` method.
