## vOMIX-snakemake

vOMIX-snakemake is the back-end pipline of the command-line tool vOMIX-MEGA: a reproducible, scalable, and fast viral metagenomic pipeline for analyzing large-scale bulk-metagenomic and viromic data. We have engineered multiple bottlenecks in current state-ofthe-art software to allow rapid and well-benchmarked viral metagenomic analysis. Here are some of vOMIX-snakemake's handy features:

:::{grid-item-card}
*High Speed*
^^^
vOMIX-snakemake operates 10-1000 times faster than current pipelines that have unoptimized underlying software dependencies.
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
*Stable Memory Footprint*
^^^
vOMIX-MEGA's standard viral end-to-end analysis takes a maximum memory of 24 Gb due to selection and fine-tuning of tools.
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
*Modular & Configurable Analysis*
^^^
Each module can be separately used with a variety of different inputs, and each software can be configured and fine-tuned for your needs.

:::{grid-item-card}
*Extensively Benchmarked*
^^^
We've benchmarked our viral identification on experimental as well as mock-data and use the best performing tools.
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
*Reproducible & Dockerized*
^^^
All analysis is logged via a snakemake back-end, which is configured with Docker to allow full reproducibility.
:::

:::{grid-item-card}
*Easy SRA Input*
^^^
Simply feed vOMIX-MEGA a list  your SRA accession codes and it will download, process, and analyse the viral community of your samples automatically.
